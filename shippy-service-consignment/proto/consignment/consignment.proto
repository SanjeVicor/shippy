THEN STEP 2 : 
    Generate the protobuf code, from your project root, run the following:
$ cd shippy-service-consignment
$ protoc -I. --go_out=plugins=grpc:. \
      proto/consignment/consignment.proto
      
This will call the protoc library, 
which is responsible for compiling your protobuf definition into code. 
We also specify the use of the grpc plugin, 
as well as the build context and the output path.
